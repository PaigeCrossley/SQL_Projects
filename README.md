# SQL_Projects

I decided to learn about SQL as it is an important tool for data analysts/scientists and the projects I complete for practice will be kept here.

I used PopSQL with MySQL.

LMS = Library Management System

I also discuss the project more in depth on my blog: https://paigecrossley.wixsite.com/blog.
